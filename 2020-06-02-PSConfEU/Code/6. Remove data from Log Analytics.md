# Remove data from Log Analytics

> Deleting data from Log Analytics has no GUI option!

You need to create an Azure AD Application (or assign permission to existing one) with Role `Data Purger`.

As Microsoft states ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/personal-data-mgmt#how-to-export-and-delete-private-data)):

> Further, it is computationally costly for Log Analytics and Application Insights, and a large volume of concurrent query or purge API calls have the potential to negatively impact all other interaction with Log Analytics functionality.
> Deletes in Log Analytics are destructive and non-reversible! Please use extreme caution in their execution.

## Why so serious

Becuase of this, I'm not creating an easy function to DELETE data from Azure Log.

You can always set a custom retention policy on your tables instead: [Azure Monitor Log Analytics retention is now configurable by data type](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/retention-by-type/)
